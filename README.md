**Description:**  
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has quickly changed our lives around the world. As of today, the total number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 105 million. In response to the alarming rise of COVID-19 cases, we have created our own solution to stay informed: CovidHub. CovidHub is an informational website that tracks the number of real-time coronavirus confirmed cases worldwide and depending on the userâ€™s location, while providing personalized recommendations on how people can better protect themselves from a daily screening test. Users can also browse the latest international coverage relating to the rapidly changing coronavirus pandemic, allowing them to stay tuned to emerging issues, closures, and advancements in the development of vaccines. 

**How it Works:**  
CovidHub allows users to navigate on different pages ranging from a daily COVID screening test to the latest and specific regional COVID trends. Starting from the homepage, this presents the user with the latest news related to COVID -19 to inform users of real-time reports of COVID. Also in the webpage, is a daily screening test that allows users to complete a checklist of symptoms and that reveals whether it is safe for the user to attend work, school, day care, etc. Next, the trends page is a space where users can enter the region or city in which they are located in order to view trends of COVID-19, including graphs of the newly reported COVID-19 cases by day. Finally, the tips and tricks for prevention page offers users multiple tips and tricks to prevent the spread of COVID.

**Our Goal:**  
Our goal with this webpage is to allow users to gain easy access to essential information and resources about COVID-19 to raise awareness of the disease and to stop its spread. We hope to make CovidHub readily available to all users around the world to improve their awareness of the pandemic and ways to prevent it.
